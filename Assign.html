<h1>Programming</h1>

<h3>Overview of the problem</h3>

You are to continue the development of software for a simple banking situation. To 
extend the simulation we wish to now introduce the following features: customers will 
now have up to three accounts, a savings account, a cheque account and a credit card 
account. Customer details will be loaded from and saved to files. An ATM 
(Automatic Teller Machine) will be included which generates transactions to be saved 
to the file used in parts 1. 

<h3>Programming additions. </h3>

Inheritance must be made use of in this assignment. You should modify the savings 
account class from part 1 to be a generic bank account similar features as 
before. From this generic bank account you will derive the specific accounts: savings, 
cheque and credit card. It is likely you will make use of polymorphic functions, a 
simple example would be to have different display functions. A quality 
assignment would also make use of pointers and linked lists instead of arrays. 

<h2>Account details</h2>

<h3>Bank account </h3>

The generic bank account should contain an account number and balance data 
members but no interest rate. Functions to deposit, withdraw and display should be 
included. The withdraw function should not allow an account to be over-drawn (a 
withdrawal more than the balance). Other functions such as setup, match, getbalance 
and getaccount number may be included. 

<h3>Savings account </h3>

The savings account should include an additional data member for the interest rate as 
in part 1. An interest calculation function will be needed. The display function 
should show the interest rate. 

<h3>Cheque account </h3>

The cheque account does not accrue interest. There should be no interest rate data 
member. The account can be over-drawn in this case by $100. The display function 
should note if an account is over-drawn. 

<h3>Credit card account </h3>

The credit card account should include an interest rate and a credit limit. The credit 
limit should be set at $5000. The interest rate is 18%. Note: a balance in this account 
represents the amount owing and the available credit = limit – balance. Therefore a 
debit will now increase the balance i.e. the amount owed. The display function should 
indicate the available credit in addition to the balance. Initially the balance will be 0 
so the available credit will be 5000. Include a function to check if the credit limit is 
exceeded and use this function in your display function. 

<h3>Customer data file </h3>

The customer data file will have the following structure: 
Name 
Address 
Account type (char code S, C, K, X) 
Account number (account 1) 
Balance (account 1) 
Account type (account 2) 
Account number (account 2) 
Balance (account 2) 
Etc 


A customer will have at least one account. In some cases they will have 2 or 3 
accounts. The end of the account list for a given customer will be signified by an X 
account type code. Study the customer.dat file and make sure you can read 
it properly. After transactions have been applied as in part 1 you should save 
the customer data back to the file. 
Account type codes: S = savings, C = cheque, K = credit card, X = end of accounts 
Allow for at least 10 customers though the initial sample file may contain 
less. 


<h3>Customer class structure </h3>

Your customer class structure needs to be modified from part 1 to allow for 
multiple accounts. You need to allow for the possibility a customer will have three 
accounts of the types described earlier. A simple Pass level solution might have 3 
individual object variables. A Distinction level or above would use a linked list and 
dynamically create the accounts as required. The search accounts function (see 
part 1 solution) will need to be modified accordingly. 
Warning: be careful considering use of an array as the objects are of different types. 

<h3>ATM Machine </h3>

The ATM component should present an on-screen interactive menu typical of such 
machines. There should be a facility similar to entering a PIN number. In this case 
you should use a customer’s account number. The customer file can be searched for 
this account and if present the machine will then display a menu with the options: 

1 Withdraw Cash 
2 Deposit 
3 Show balance 
4 Quit 

Multiple operations on the one account should be possible and multiple 
accounts/customers should be able to be dealt with. Each operation should generate a 
transaction which is appended to a fresh transaction file. Use a different file name and 
provide a facility for entering the file name when processing transactions. A PIN of 9999 
should be used to quit the machine. This transaction file can then be run against 
the customer data as in part 1. Transactions in the file should have the same 
format as in part 1. 
Hint: It is suggested that your ATM class contain a customer object (and possibly a 
bank account object) or pointers to these so you can load a customer’s data in order to 
generate the transactions. 

<h3>Operation of your program </h3>

Your program should read the customer data and transaction file supplied
and correctly apply the transactions to the customers and their accounts. Your 
program should produce a balance for all customers on screen first then apply the 
transactions, producing an on-screen display of the account and the transaction then 
produce an updated balance on screen for every customer. Customers should be 
updated in the customer file. 
The program should then enter ATM mode and allow operations on accounts. After 
exiting the ATM mode the new transactions generated should be applied to the 
customer data file and the updated customer data stored. A final update balance for all 
customers should then be displayed on screen. 

<h2>Suggested stages of development</h2>

<h3>Stage 1</h3>

Develop the generic bank account class and derive savings account, cheque account 
and credit card classes. Modify the customer class to contain objects of these types. 
Add suitable functions to the customer class to read and write the customer data. 
Make sure your program can read all customer and transaction data from the files
and produce correct balances as in part 1. 
Additional comments: On-screen display may be sparse, code style (identifier 
naming, use of variables, use of functions, object-orientedness, use of comments) may 
be deficient in some respects. One or two minor errors in calculations or omissions 
will be accepted. ATM functionality, if included may be procedural in nature. 

<h3>Stage 2</h3>

Add the ATM class and develop suitable functions to generate and write new 
transactions to the transaction file. Make sure you can run the new transactions 
against the updated customer data from stage 1 and produce new balances. 
Additional grading comments: On-screen display should be good, well-laid out and 
there should be few code style issues (see Pass level above). Calculations should all 
be correct (check them and make sure). 

<h3>Stage 3</h3>

Incorporate pointers and linked lists into your program for example in storing the 
different account types for a customer. You may write your own linked list code or 
use the code for unordered linked lists as supplied as a starting point. 
Hint: Declare the list to be of generic bank account type then assign derived object 
types to the list. 
There should be essentially no faults in coding style 
(see above) and screen display should be clear and easy to use. Calculations must all 
be correct. Linked list implementation or use of pointers may be deficient in some 
respects. 

<h3>Stage 4</h3>

Extend the use of linked lists to the storage of customers and transactions in classes 
such as ProcessTrans (see part 1). 
Linked list implementation & pointer use should be  good otherwise as for distinction level.
